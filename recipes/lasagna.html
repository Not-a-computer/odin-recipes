    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe will describe how to cook a simple, perfect, crispy lasagna. This is more of a relative guide on how I personally make lasagna, and the ingredients aren't perfectly measured.
    </p>
    <p>
        For most of the ingredients, I just use an amount that I think will work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the ingredients are optional too, such as Worcestershire sauce, parmesan cheese and cream cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna Sheets</li>
               
        <li>500g Mince</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Small Onion, 1/2 Large Onion</li>
        <li>2-4 Cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>500g Pasata</li>
        <li>Stick of Celary</li>
        <li>A Carrot</li>
        <li>2-4 Button Mushroom</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>Block of Cheese</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
               
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <l>Cream Cheese</l>
        

    </ul>
    <p>First, we will be creating the bolognese:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The first step to your bolognese would be the vegtables. Dice all of the vegtables except the carrot which will be grated. With your diced mushrooms, add them to a pan with a small amount of water and fry them on a medium heat. I like to add a small bit of garlic granules and salt to them for taste.</li>
        <li>Once the mushrooms have had a decent amount of the moisture cooked out of them, store them for later use.</li>
        <li>Next, will be the onions. Put olive oil in a pan on high temperature, then once the oil is hot put the onions in and keep moving the onions for about a minute on high, then drop the temperature on low. Keep the onions cooking low until they brown quite decently</li>
        <li>Once the onions have browned a bit, add the diced celery and </li>
    </ol>
