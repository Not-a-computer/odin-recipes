        This recipe isn't really a recipe, it is more of a technique but as I enjoy it so much I'd thought I'd add it.
    </p>
    <p>This 'recipe' will describe how to make the most amazing and custardy scrambled eggs you have ever eaten.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now we will be moving onto the technique, which is rather simple. All you will need is a pan.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First, put your eggs into some sort of bowl, jug or container and beat them until they are mixed well together.</li>
        <li>Next, put the eggs in a cold pan, then put them on the stove on a medium-low heat and keep stirring the eggs.</li>
        <li>Once the eggs start to cook and start to become slightly solid, take the pan off the heat and keep stirring, and a small bit of butter prefferably cold, about half a teaspoon.</li>
        <li>Put the eggs back on the heat and keep repeating this process of: off the heat when it starts cooking, add butter, back on the heat. And remember to keep stirring.</li>
        <li>Do this until thhe egss become a similar texture to a custard, or until you like them.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After the eggs have cooked, I like to put them on some nice bread with avocado and hot sauce, and add salt and pepper to taste.</p>
